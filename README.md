Small balance changes to PFA.

Fork of: https://github.com/CameruptQDX/PF-Roaming-Red

# Changelist

## System changes

- Wild mons no longer scale their evolution. This is to incentivize their usage and training from lower tiers. Wild mon levels still scale and trainer battles still scale evos.

## Type changes:

| Pokemon   | Original Type |  New Type |
|----------|:-------------:|:------:|
| Scythero | Bug | Bug/Normal |
| Morphus |  Poison |  Poison/Normal |

## Encounter changes:

- Wakkazoid no longer found in Safari Zone to make the static encounter more special.

## Other changes:

- HM moves can be forgotten. Softlocking should be impossible since Cinnebar is accessible by foot, and everywhere else you can always black out.
- "Mew under the truck" event.
- Increased TM availability.
