Small balance changes to PFA.

Fork of: https://github.com/CameruptQDX/PF-Roaming-Red

# Changelist

## Type changes:

| Pokemon   | Original Type |  New Type |
|----------|:-------------:|:------:|
| Scythero | Bug | Bug/Normal |
| Morphus |  Poison |  Poison/Normal |

## Encounter changes:

- Wakkazoid no longer found in Safari Zone to make the static encounters more hype.
- Ideally removing all stone-evolution wild encounters to incentivize usage and training of their pre-evos. Will need to check the PF-Roaming-Red scaling encounter changes to see how feasible.

## Other changes:

- "Mew under the truck" event
- Increased TM availability
